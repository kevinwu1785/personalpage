	<p>Welcome! My name is Kevin (Tse-Luen) Wu, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester.</p>
	<p>My research centers on the consequences of political institutions, with a focus on how they shape the behavior of voters, politicians, and parties. 
	Using empirical methods, I examine how institutional design and party strategies jointly influence the distribution of political power and patterns of representation in democracies. 
	My work highlights the dynamic interplay between formal rules and strategic behavior, showing how institutions not only constrain but also enable political actors in shaping outcomes.<p>
	<p>Before coming to Rochester, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from National Taiwan University. I was a legislative assistant in the Legislative Yuan from 2017 to 2018.</p>
