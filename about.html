	<p>Welcome! My name is Kevin (Tse-Luen) Wu, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester.</p>
	<p>My current research centers on the consequences of political institutions, with a focus on how they shape the behavior of voters, politicians, and parties. 
	I apply a range of empirical methods, primarily causal inference, to examine how the dynamic interplay between institutional design and party strategies shapes the distribution of political power and patterns of representation in democracies.<p>
	<p>Before coming to Rochester, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from National Taiwan University.</p>
