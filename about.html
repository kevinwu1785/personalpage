	<p>Welcome! My name is Kevin (Tse-Luen) Wu, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester.</p>
	<p>My research centers on the consequences of political institutions, with a focus on how electoral rules shape the behavior of voters, politicians, and parties. 
	I am particularly interested in how individuals respond strategically to institutional incentives, such as changes in electoral systems or candidate selection mechanisms. 
	Using rigorous empirical methods, I examine how institutional design and party strategy jointly influence the distribution of political power, resource flows, and patterns of representation in democratic systems. 
	My work highlights the dynamic interplay between formal rules and strategic behavior, showing how institutions not only constrain but also enable political actors in shaping outcomes.<p>
	<p>Before coming to Rochester, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from National Taiwan University. I was a legislative assistant in the Legislative Yuan from 2017 to 2018.</p>
