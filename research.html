	<p>
        How do members of Congress secure positions on influential committees or attain leadership roles? 
	Although a question receiving substantial academic attention, financial contributions to party organizations, what we term a ”party tax”, has received limited recent analysis. 
	We revisit this mechanism with new data and updated methods by examining member contributions as indicators of willingness and capacity to support party goals financially. 
	Our findings suggest that such contributions are particularly consequential for members occupying elite committee and leadership positions, consistent with theories of concentrated institutional power. 
	Highlighting partisan differences, effects are more pronounced among Republicans. Using change-point analysis, we find formal institutionalization of party dues produced meaningful shifts, particularly among rank-and-file members, rather than codifying existing practices. 
	Addressing causal concerns, we apply coarsened exact matching, showing that members ascending to more powerful positions subsequently increase their party contributions–reinforcing a feedback loop where financial supporters are rewarded with desirable placements. 
	Together, our results underscore a strategic process by which monetary contributions facilitate access to institutional power and further entrench partisan resource flows.</p>

		  <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p>
        Existing research shows that institutions shape strategic voting, yet most evidence comes from parliamentary democracies. Other types of democracies remain less explored. 
			This study investigates the causal impact of institutional change on strategic voting in Taiwan, a semi-presidential democracy, using a within-country research design. 
			In 2008, Taiwan shifted from a multi-member to a single-member district system for parliamentary elections, while the rules for local council elections remained unchanged. 
			Leveraging this institutional change, I implement a difference-in-differences framework, supplemented by individual-level survey evidence to assess strategic voting under different electoral rules. 
			The results reveal a significant rise in strategic voting following the reform, particularly in districts that experienced larger seat reductions. Survey data further indicate that supporters of minor parties were especially likely to vote strategically or change their party identification. 
			These behavioral shifts appear to be driven primarily by voters rather than by parties, suggesting that individuals responded quickly and adaptively to the new electoral incentives.

          <strong>Kevin Wu</strong>. “Win For Women or Dynasties? Consequences of Gender Quotas in Taiwan”
		   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p>
        What are the consequences of gender quotas? This paper investigates the impact of Taiwan’s gender quota rule in local council elections. The findings show that the quotas not only increased women’s descriptive representation but also elevated the presence of another political group: dynastic politicians. 
		Utilizing a regression discontinuity design based on the quota thresholds, I provide causal evidence of these shifts in representation. The interplay between a candidate-centered electoral system (SNTV-MMD) and a one-quarter gender quota has improved the electoral viability of dynastic candidates and incentivized major parties to recruit from political families, thereby reinforcing their dominance in local politics. 
		An analysis of legislative speeches and bill proposals further reveals that the frequency of women-related policy demands has increased in constituencies with quotas. Under certain conditions, dynastic politicians are even more likely to advocate for women’s rights, challenging the conventional view that dynasties are less supportive of such policies.
