		 <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p>
        How do members of Congress secure positions on influential committees or attain leadership roles? 
		While this question has received substantial scholarly attention, the role of financial contributions to party organizations—what we term a “party tax”—has received relatively limited recent analysis. We revisit this mechanism by examining member contributions as indicators of both willingness and capacity to support party goals financially. 
		Our findings suggest that such contributions are particularly consequential for members occupying elite committee and leadership positions, consistent with theories of concentrated institutional power. These effects are especially pronounced among Republicans, highlighting partisan differences in how financial resources are leveraged for institutional advancement. 
		Using change-point analysis, we demonstrate that the formal institutionalization of party dues produced meaningful shifts, particularly among non-leadership members, rather than simply codifying existing practices. 
		To address causal concerns, we apply coarsened exact matching, which shows that members who ascend to more powerful positions subsequently increase their contributions to party leaders—reinforcing a feedback loop in which financial supporters are rewarded with desirable placements. 
		Together, these results underscore a strategic process in which monetary contributions facilitate access to institutional power and further entrench partisan resource flows.

          <strong>Kevin Wu</strong>. “Do Institutions Cause Strategic Voting? Evidence from Taiwan”
		  <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p>
        It has been demonstrated that institutions play a crucial role in strategic voting. 
		While most studies compare democratic systems across different countries, few investigate institutional changes within a single democracy—especially in non-parliamentary systems. 
		This study examines the causal relationship between institutional reform and strategic voting, using electoral data from before and after Taiwan’s 2008 parliamentary electoral reform. 
		The reform involved a transition from a multi-member district system to a single-member district system, while the local council election system remained unchanged, enabling the use of a difference-in-differences framework. 
		The findings indicate that strategic voting intensified after the reform, with votes increasingly concentrated on candidates from the two major parties. 
		Additionally, individual-level survey data reveal that many voters quickly adjusted their party affiliations in response to the reform.

          <strong>Kevin Wu</strong>. “Win For Women or Dynasties? Consequences of Gender Quotas in Taiwan”
		   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p>
        What are the consequences of gender quotas? This paper investigates the impact of Taiwan’s gender quota rule in local council elections. The findings show that the quotas not only increased women’s descriptive representation but also elevated the presence of another political group: dynastic politicians. 
		Utilizing a regression discontinuity design based on the quota thresholds, I provide causal evidence of these shifts in representation. The interplay between a candidate-centered electoral system (SNTV-MMD) and a one-quarter gender quota has improved the electoral viability of dynastic candidates and incentivized major parties to recruit from political families, thereby reinforcing their dominance in local politics. 
		An analysis of legislative speeches and bill proposals further reveals that the frequency of women-related policy demands has increased in constituencies with quotas. Under certain conditions, dynastic politicians are even more likely to advocate for women’s rights, challenging the conventional view that dynasties are less supportive of such policies.
